Top Universities in the USA

This tool is designed to help you choose schools to attend in the United States based on data from 2018. Select a state to view the top schools ranked by several categories. By default, the charts show the top 30 schools based on US News' annual rankings. Place your cursor over the bars on the graphs for more information about individual schools. This tool does not include America's many colleges that do not have university status.
