This tool is designed to help you choose a university to attend in the United States based on data from 2018. Select a state to view the top schools ranked by several categories. By default, the charts show the top 30 schools based on US News' annual rankings. Place your cursor over the bars on the graphs for more information about individual schools. Click on a bar to save the school for later.

The data used in this tool is from Kaggle user Christopher Lambert's University Statistics dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/theriley106/university-statistics) via US News & World Report. It should be noted that this tool does not include America's many colleges that do not have university status.

This application is the final project for the Spring 2018 Visualization course taught by Megan Monroe at Tufts University.
